# Stitch

A tool inspired by the Linux/*NIX 'make' tool, but for ComputerCraft:Tweaked. This comparison is used loosely, as all it really
does is slap together a collection of files into what's effectively still plaintext. In theory, one could use this with CraftOS-PC and slap together a snipped up file in a practical application.

As if a practical application would happen.

# Documentation

Currently, there are two forms of docs, <u>Plaintext</u> and <u>Markdown</u>. They contain almost the same content with some wording and stylistic changes made to fit each respective type.

# Contributing

Contributing is easy. Fork the repo, make your changes, and toss a pull request in. I'll review it and if it solves a valid problem and doesn't make 100 more, it'll get accepted.
