# Stitch

A tool inspired by the Linux/*NIX 'make' tool, but for ComputerCraft:Tweaked. This comparison is used loosely, as all it really
does is slap together a collection of files into what's effectively still plaintext. In theory, one could use this with CraftOS-PC and slap together a snipped up file in a practical application.

As if a practical application would happen.
