# Stitch

A tool inspired by the Linux/*NIX 'make' tool, but for ComputerCraft:Tweaked. This comparison is used loosely, as all it really
does is slap together a collection of files into what's effectively still plaintext. In theory, one could use this with CraftOS-PC and slap together a snipped up file in a practical application.

As if a practical application would happen.

# Documentation

All documentation is written in LaTeX, and found at `docs/stitch-documentation.tex`. It's intended to be used with `pdflatex` in order to make a readable PDF file. Alternatively, you can just read through the bare LaTeX without compiling, which is fair enough. For Linux/*NIX systems, your package manager may have TeX environments up to install, but make sure to check, it's more case-by-case. For Windows, I recommend going to `https://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html` and installing from there.

Alternatively, with Linux/*NIX there is always the good old option of compiling from source.
