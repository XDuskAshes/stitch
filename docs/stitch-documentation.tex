\section*{Introduction}
\hspace{12pt}
Stitch is a tool made in the general spirit of 'make' on Unix-like/Linux systems. It intakes a file with a listing of files to put together, in order of how to put them together, and pops out an output file as defined. This is a heavy ignorance of how 'make' actually works, but this is just made in the \textit{spirit} of 'make', not made to be exactly like it\footnote{Even if that was the original plan, it is not anymore.}. 'make' is far more complex, has many many more steps, and is much more practical.
